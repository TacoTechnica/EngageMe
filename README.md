# EngageMe
Made with care at MHacks 12

## What it does:
Tracks and optimizes viewer engagement over cross platform distributions using machine learning and blockchain and classifies the most optimally interesting parts of the video and deploys cloud solutions to users in real time with the video progress bar.

## How it works:
The Chrome extension uses the HTML5 <video> tag, looking at when the user takes action to change the part of the video they are at. After the user is done watching this video, we push this information to the backend, which aggregates all user-tracked time data and determines what the most watched segments were. We then display this with a unique color onto the progress bar.
